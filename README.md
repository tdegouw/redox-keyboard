# Redox-keyboard
Configuration files for my redox keyboard, it features a switchable Qwerty / Colemac layout and is focussed at programming. Had a hard time finding such a layout, hope it helps someone as a basis.

Some notes:

Lefmost modifier key: I often use by pressing my lower part of pinky finger down on the  keyboard, therefore switching to arrow navigation/thinking mode. Hence the modifier key there.

My muscle memory for programming is fixed on Qwerty at the moment, colemac is  just for typing documents.

Suggestions to optimize it more welcome!
